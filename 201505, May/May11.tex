	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Install \LaTeX\ for these notes
		\item Get access to the repository and Gauley
		\item Read through all of Logan's previous notes
		\item Brush up on R by looking through the user manual
		\item Begin looking through the code on the repository
		\item Create a repository for these notes
	\end{enumerate}

	\subsection{Install \LaTeX\ for these notes}
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item \LaTeX has been installed and tested
		\end{enumerate}
	
	\subsection{Get access to the repository and Gauley}
		 \begin{enumerate}
		 	\item With Dr. Gilchrist, I was able to get access to both repositories (the one with Logan's notes and the one containing CUBfits). I also was granted an account on Gauley.
		 \end{enumerate}
	\subsection{Read through all of Logan's previous notes} 
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item I should check out his script repository later, when I need to begin testing this. He says it's located at https://github.com/ozway/cubmisc
			\item After reading through all the notes, it appears that his code is close to completion. There are a few things that he mentioned wanting to do, and I'm not sure if he got around to those.
			\item He mentions moving the code to C from R, but he feels that it would be more work than it is worth.
			\item He also mentions debugging his genome creation process by using a genome that is totally dominated by mutation bias, and see if the genome is correctly created across all phi values.
			\item He also mentions changing some divisions to subtractions using logarithm rules, since that would be quicker.
			
			\item Just some terminology that I need to remember:
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item CBU -- codon usage bias
				\item $ \eta $ -- cost-benefit ratio of protein synthesis
				\item $ \phi $ -- protein synthesis rate
				\item $ N_e $ ??
				\item ROC -- ribosome overhead costs
				\item NSE ??
				\item ORFs -- Open Reading Frames
				\item $ q $ -- proportional decline in fitness per ATP wasted per unit time
				\item $ \delta M $ -- mutation bias
				\item $ E(\phi) $ -- expected protein synthesis rate, should be 1 if time units are defined correctly
				
			\end{enumerate} 
		\end{enumerate}
